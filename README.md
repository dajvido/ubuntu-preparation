# Ubuntu preparation
This is set of scripts to automate installation of applications which I always install after re-installing Ubuntu system.

## Installation
Run single script to install specific application or `install.sh` script to install them all.

To run the script without downloading the install script:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dajvido/ubuntu-preparation/master/install.sh)"
```

## Important
The scripts install specific versions which **may be outdated or unstable**. 
It's facilitation for myself. Run it only after reading the code and **at your own risk**.
